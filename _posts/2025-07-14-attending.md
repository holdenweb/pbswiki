If you have never attended an unconference before, this page should give you some idea what to expect.
You can find the Wikipedia definition of "unconference" [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference).

Have you notice how, when you go to a conference, the most interesting conversations often happen outside the organised sessions?
