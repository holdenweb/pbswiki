Have you notice how, when you go to a conference, the most interesting conversations you have happen outside the organised sessions?
Unconferences encourage those kinds of interactions.

You may never have attended an unconference before. This page should give you some idea what to expect.
You can find the Wikipedia definition of "unconference" [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference).

Perhaps you've been to PyCon open space sessions, which are based on very much the same ideas.
If you want to know more about what to expect, there's some good basic advice in
[this page](https://unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference-2/).

Here's a [report from an unconference fan](https://benyeoh.substack.com/p/why-unconference)
from a self-confessed unconference fan about an event he attended last year
on the topic of overseas ventures of a philanthropic nature.
Yes, unconferences don't have to be on technical topics!

Most of all, and much more than a traditional conference with speakers and schedules,
unconferences give everyone a chance to pursue topics they are interested in.
