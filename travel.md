# Getting There

Bexhill is well-served by transport options.

### By Air

**From Gatwick**, which is considerably closer than Heathrow,
simply use the direct rail link to Bexhill from the airport station. _~ 1 hr 20_.

**From Heathrow** there is a bus service from Heathrow to Gatwick, which takes about an hour,
so one possibility is to take that and then follow the instructions above. _~2 hrs 50_.
Otherwise, take the Heathrow Express train from Heathrow to Paddington,
catch the London Underground Circle Line to Victoria then follow the rail instructions below. _~3 hrs 15_.

### By Rail

Major stations still have ticket offices, as well as ticket machines.
You can book in advance and collect your tickets from a machine
(you may need the card you used to book),
but neither of the routes below offer reservations.

**From Victoria**
Trains to Ore and Hastings go through Bexhill.
You could also take the train to Eastbourne or Brighton,
but this requires a change at Hampden Park
where you need to cross the line via a footbridge or walk about half a mile. _~2 hrs_.

From the M25 there are two major routes:
either take the A21 South to Hastings then travel West along the A259 to Bexhill,
or take the M23 (which becomes the A23) South then travel East along the A27 and the A259 to Bexhill.
