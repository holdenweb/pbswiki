# Join the inaugural event

Ticketing for this event is being handled by [Eventbrite](https://pybysea.eventbrite.com).

**Cancellations** If you have to cancel, we will give you a full refund less a Â£25 handling charge up until 1 September, 2025.
After that, no refunds can be offered.

Tickets no longer required can, on request until 9 September, be transferred to another recipient
with whom you should make private arrangements about reimbursement. No scalping!

That's enough.
